# OK_Cupid_Shiny
Data Visualization project for OK Cupid data set

# Setup steps
1. Add the `3-profiles.csv` file to your project root
2. Install required packages
For `rflow` package installation, devtools is needed:
 ```
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/numeract/rflow')
```
3. Run server.R
4. First run will take a while given the fact that the project uses a cacheing mechanism. 
After the firs run Shiny app will run smoothly.
